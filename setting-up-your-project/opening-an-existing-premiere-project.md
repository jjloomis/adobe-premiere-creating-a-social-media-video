2. [Open Premiere](/setting-up-your-project/opening-premiere.md).
3. Click File on the menu bar.
4. In the fly-out menu, choose Open Project.
5. [Navigate to and select](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/navigating-folder-tree.html) your Premier project file \(PRPROJ\).
