# Adding an Audio File to Your Sequence

**Note**: If you haven't already done so, [download a free music file](/setting-up-your-project/downloading-free-music-from-youtube-to-your-project-folder.md) to your project folder. Then [import the music file to Project panel](/importing-and-working-with-media-files/importing-media-files.md).

1. Locate the audio file in the Project panel.
2. Click and drag the audio file from the Project panel into your sequence. Note: Audio files go in the audio tracks of a sequence \(A1, A2, etc.\)
