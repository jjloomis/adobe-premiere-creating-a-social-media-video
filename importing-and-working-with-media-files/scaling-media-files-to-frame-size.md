# Scaling Images to Fit Frame Size

Most iPhones, iPads, and still cameras capture photos that are larger than the size of your sequence********. So before adding images to your sequence, you'll need to scale them to match the frame size of your sequence.

1. In the Project panel, select all of your images. **Note**: You can click in the Project panel and then press **Command A** \(on your keyboard.\) This will select everything in the Project panel. Only images and videos are affected by **Scale to Frame Size**.
2. Go to **Clip** on the menu bar. Select **Video Option** and choose **Scale to Frame Size**.
