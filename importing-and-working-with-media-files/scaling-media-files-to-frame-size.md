# Scaling Images to Fit Frame Size

Most iPhones, iPads, and still cameras capture photos that are larger than the size of your sequence. So before adding images to your sequence, you'll need to scale them to match the frame size of your sequence.

1. In the Project panel, select all of your image files. **Note**: In the Project panel, you can switch to List view \(lower-left\) and Shift-click or Command-click to select multiple images.
2. Go to Clip on the menu bar. Select Video Option and choose Scale to Frame Size.
