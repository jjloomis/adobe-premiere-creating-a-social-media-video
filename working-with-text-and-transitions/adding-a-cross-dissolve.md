# Adding a Cross Dissolve

1. In the Workspaces bar, click **Effects**. The Effects panel will open on the right.
2. In the Effects panel, expand **Video Transition**s. Then expand **Dissolve**.
3. Click and drag the **Cross Dissolve** icon to the area where you would like the transition to appear. **Note**: You may need to [Zoom in](/importing-and-working-with-media-files/zooming-in-and-out.md) to see the Cross Dissolve in your sequence. 
4. To adjust the duration of the Cross Dissolve, press `Control` \(on keyboard\) and click the transition in the Timeline. In the fly-out menu, choose `Set Transition Duration`.
5. In the Set Transition Duration dialog box, enter a new duration for your transition. Note: The duration time format is `Hours:Minutes:Seconds:Frames`.
6. Click `OK` to apply the new Transition duration. Repeat this process for other Cross Dissolve transitions as you see fit.
