# Opening the JAMS Text Template

The JAMS Text Template lives in the root of your class folder. You'll bring it into your Premiere project before adding it to your sequence.

1. If you haven't already done so, [download the JAMS Text Template](/setting-up-your-project/downloading-the-jams-text-template-to-your-project-folder.md) to your project folder.
2. In the Workspaces bar, click Graphics. The Essential Graphics panel will open on the right.
3. In the Essential Graphics panel, make sure the Browse tab is selected. Click the **Install Motion Graphics Template** icon \(folder with arrow\) next to the Essential Graphics drop-down menu.
4. In the Open dialog box, navigate to and select the JAMS-Text-Template.mogrt file. Click **Open**. JAMS-Text-Template will appear in the Essential Graphics panel.
