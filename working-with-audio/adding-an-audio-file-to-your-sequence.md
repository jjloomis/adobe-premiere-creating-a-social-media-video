# Adding an Audio File to Your Sequence

Before you can edit your audio file, youâ€™ll need to import it into your Premire project. Once imported, your audio file will appear in the Project panel.

1. If you have not already done so, [download a free music file to your project folder](/setting-up-your-project/downloading-free-music-from-youtube-to-your-project-folder.md). **Note**: If you do not download the music file into your project folder, your Premiere project will not work.
2. In your Premiere project, go to **File** on the menu bar and select **Import**.
3. Navigate to your project folder and the select the music file \(MP3\) you would like to import. You may need to [drill down in the folder tree](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/navigating-folder-tree.html) 
4. Click **Import**. Your media files will appear as clips the Project panel.
