## Computer is Trying to Open a JAMS Text Template in Photoshop

If your computer tries to open the template file in Photoshop, you may have accidentally left-clicked \(aka, "normally clicked"\) the template file link \(instead of control-clicking it.\) If this happens, Safari will download the file. Then your operating system will try to open it \(using Photoshop.\) The template file's format will confuse Photoshop and Photoshop will give you an error message.

1. Quit Photoshop.
2. Download the MOGRT file using the steps outlined in [downloading a JAMS text template to your project folder](/setting-up-your-project/downloading-the-jams-text-template-to-your-project-folder.md).
