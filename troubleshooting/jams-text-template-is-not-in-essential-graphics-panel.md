## JAMS Text Template Is Not in Essential Graphics Panel

If a JAMS Text Template is not in the Essential Graphics panel \(even though you imported it earlier\), you'll need to [import it into your project](/working-with-text-and-transitions/importing-a-jams-text-template.md) again. 

If a JAMS Text Template is imported into the Essential Graphics panel but not added to your sequence prior to saving and closing Premiere, it is purged from the Essential Graphics panel. Importing the JAMS Text Template again solves this problem.
