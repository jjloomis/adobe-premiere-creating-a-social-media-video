## JAMS Text Templates Are Not in Essential Graphics Panel

If JAMS Text Templates are missing from your Essential Graphics tab, you'll need to [import them into your project](/working-with-text-and-transitions/importing-a-jams-text-template.md) again. JAMS Text Templates that haven't been added to your sequence are removed from the Essential Graphics panel when you save and quit Premiere.
